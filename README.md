# IBM-Quantum-Challenge-2024
Welcome to the IBM Quantum Challenge, the annual code challenge focused on how to use Qiskit. Whether you’re a newcomer or a seasoned veteran, there is something here for you.

The Quantum Challenge consists of a series of Jupyter notebooks that contain tutorial material, code examples, and auto-graded coding challenges for you to fill in. We call each of these notebooks a “lab”.

Unsure where or how to open each Jupyter notebook? Here's a great list of possible tools, and you can find more specific instructions on the Discord.

Please join us on the Quantum Challenge Discord
